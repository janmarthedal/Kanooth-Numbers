    <h1>Sputsoft Numbers</h1>

    <p>
      Sputsoft Numbers is a C++ library for doing multiple-precision arithmetic.
      The underlying theory and design can be found among the
      <a href="http://sputsoft.com/tag/multiple-precision/">multiple-precision articles</a> at
      <a href="http://sputsoft.com">sputsoft.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library is header-only and highly portable, relying only on some
      <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> libraries. It is possible, however, to obtain highly
      optimized code by choosing the <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> backend. This requires no
      code changes, but only setting a preprocessor macro and linking to the GMP library
      (see below).
    </p>

    <h3>Installation and Basic Usage</h3>

    <p>
      Since the library is header-only, you only need to place all the files from the library
      somewhere locally and instruct your C++ compiler to use the directory containing the
      <span class="code">sputsoft</span> folder as an include directory. The
      <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> libraries needed are
      <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/integer/doc/html/boost_integer/traits.html">integer traits</a>
      and <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm">shared pointer</a>.
      So, assuming that boost is somewhere among your compiler's standard include search paths,
      you should be able to compile using, e.g.,
    </p>
    <pre>
  g++ -I. test.cpp
    </pre>
    <p>
      if using the GNU C++ compiler and the current directory contains the
      <span class="code">sputsoft</span> folder.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the library uses generic and portable C++ code for the low-level arithmetic
      routines. If you wish to use the low-level routines from the
      <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> library, you can compile the program from above as
    </p>
    <pre>
  g++ -I. test.cpp -DSPUTSOFT_USE_GMP -lgmp
    </pre>
    <p>
      assuming that the GMP library is installed and available on the platform.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Types, Initialization and Assignment</h3>

    <p>
      The data types currently supported are <span class="code">natural_number</span> and
      <span class="code">integer</span>. They can be initialized in four ways: No initializer
      (set to zero), set to built-in integer, set to C/C++ string, or set to the value of another
      variable of the same type. For instance,
      <pre>
  natural_number a;
  natural_number b = 2u;
  natural_number c = "1234";
  natural_number d = b;
      </pre>
      Assignment is done using the '=' operator or <span class="code">set</span>.
